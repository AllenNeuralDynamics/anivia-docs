title: "Labeling multiple animals"
---

Anivia supports labeling multiple animals, but only if you export to a SLEAP file currently.

The interface focuses on one animal "instance" at a time. By default when you click to place points it places them in instance 0. 

Here is how you navigate the instance interface:

- "i" for new instance (or circle plus in toolbar)
- "u" to delete an instance  (or circle minus in toolbar)
- up and down arrows to switch between instances (or circle up and down in toolbar, or just click on a point from that instance)
