- See all the views at once!
- You can toggle to another view by clicking on it
- Points are colored by reprojection error: green is low error, red is high error.
  - It's the mean error across all views, per point. You'll have to discern which view(s) are causing the issue.
- Project points based on other views! (this feature feels magical to me)
  - Delete points you want projected (select and press "d" or click the "x" at the top)
  - Click "Project missing points"
  - Any point visible in 2+ other views will be projected onto current view
