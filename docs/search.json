By default when you click to place points it places them in instance 0.\nHere is how you navigate the instance interface: - “i” for new instance (or circle plus in toolbar) - “u” to delete an instance (or circle minus in toolbar) - up and down arrows to switch between instances (or circle up and down in toolbar, or just click on a point from that instance)",
